# 1. X = 1 is valid as you are just assigning an int value to a variable
# 2. X = Y is invali as Y does not have an assigned value
# 3. X = Y + 2 is invalid as Y does not have an assigned value
# 4. X + 1 = 3 is invalid as an operator cannot be on the variable side of an assignment
# 5. X + Y = Y + X is invalid as Y is not defined and an operator cannot be on the variable side of an assignment
